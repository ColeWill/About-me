## Ideal Company

I just got out of working for a Dish Network as a low level employee, so I don't see myself returning to a giant soul-sucking corporation.  But I definetly want to be somewhere that is stable.

I will be very flexible towards my first position, because I know I'll be able to leverage my first year or two of experience to get to the job that I really want, after that.  As long as I'm a Dev I will make it work!
