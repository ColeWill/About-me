## Ideal Company

Stability and Benefits.  I have had fun working just about every part of the stack and would Ideally find a job that offers great training and mentorship.

I will be very flexible towards my first position, because I know I'll be able to leverage my first year or two of experience to get to the job that I really want, after that.  As long as I'm a Dev I will make it work!
